## 🚀 Why it’s a Single File (and why that’s impressive)

We intentionally built SnapSpend as a **self-contained single-file app** because:

### ✅ 1️⃣ Runs anywhere — even locally on a phone
Open the file in your browser. That’s it.  
Works on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux.

### 🔒 2️⃣ Privacy-first
All expenses are stored in **Local Storage**.  
Your data never leaves your device.

### ⚡ 3️⃣ Super fast
One file = instant load. No extra requests. No lag.

### 🔧 4️⃣ Zero setup / DevOps
Upload it, share it, or just double-click to run.

### 🌎 5️⃣ Offline-friendly
Keeps working without internet  
(AI receipt scanning needs internet only when used).

> **Single-file architecture = portable, private, and lightning fast.**
